## CNN to identify malign moles on skin
This project pretend to create a CNN to predict the presence of malign moles
on the skin.
- Sample images of benign moles:

## First Model: CNN from scratch
My first try is to construct a simple Convolutional Neural Network with 3 layers.
The results obtained until now can be shown on the ROC curve presented below:
